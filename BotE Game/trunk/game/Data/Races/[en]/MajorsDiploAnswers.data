MAJOR1:
We agree to these terms - and we project that both sides will profit from them in many ways.
This agreement marks a first step in the right direction. The Coalition Of Planets will gladly sign this treaty of friendship.
Military co-operation will further stabilise this region of space. We accept your offer.
An alliance between our two governments can only increase our cultural understanding, and broaden our influence. We will sign the treaty.
A lasting peace in this quadrant is at the very core of our objectives. This non-aggression treaty is a crucial step towards achieving this goal!
Your people can confide in the protection of the Coalition of Planets. We accept the defence pact.
Drastic times call for drastic measures, especially when galactic freedom is at stake. Despite our natural scepticism we will stand at your side but we insist on ending this war as soon as the enemy surrenders!
In light of the current military situation we will accept your demand.
Economic co-operation does not benefit us at this time. We cannot concur.
You would benefit greatly from our friendship… We are flattered, however we are currently unable to commit to it.
Military affiliation is a step too big. For the time being both our fleets will operate separately.
The military benefits of an alliance at this time are marginal at best. We must regretfully decline.
We are an open-minded culture, but circumstances do not allow us to follow our natural instincts. We will not be signing a treaty of non-aggression.
A defensive alliance is an intriguing option, but timing is unfavorable. We must decline.
The Coalition of Planets will have no part in your foolish war! We reject and utterly condemn your war plan.
Your idle threats are misguided. The Coalition of Planets does not pay tribute!
The Coalition of Planets condemns this provocation! If a diplomatic solution cannot be found, you may come to regret your overconfidence!
MAJOR2:
It is always a great pleasure for the Heyoun to tap into new markets. We gladly accept your offer of commerce. Let us do trade from now on.
We are sure to benefit from your offer in terms of profit. The Heyoun Trade Union has signed the treaty.
Of course we accept your offer. A military cooperation makes up splendidly for both sides!
We have recalculated your offer of military cooperation several times and come to the conclusion to sign it.
The Heyoun Trade Union hereby accepts the current frontline between our territories. Our ships were advised to avoid your area of commerce until our traders are allowed to navigate through your systems.
This mutual defence treaty will contribute to safeguarding our trade routes. We secure our sales markets in your territory and you protect our home area of commerce likewise in return.
Our armament trusts strongly welcome your war treaty. Troops and supplies will be ready in time.
We see your demand as an investment and will meet your requirements.
Unfortunately the current state of affairs does not permit such a treaty. In spite of objections of our analysts this treaty of commerce will not come into being.
Why have friends when you can also have business partners? The Heyoun Trade Union is not interested in a friendship.
A cooperation at this time is everything but profitable. We must duly decline your offer.
An alliance with your people? Why shall we put our welfare at such a risk? You have nothing of value to offer the Heyoun Trade Union. Military affiliation will be out of question.
Representatives of our leading armament trusts came to an agreement with the Grand King that this non-aggression deal is worthless. We will decline.
The Heyoun Trade Union sees no reason for a non-aggression pact with your people. Our defense budget is sufficient to deal with threats.
Why shall we dump this enormous sales volume? This war agreement lacks every trace of rationality. We must decline!
There are more promising ways to invest credits than to throw it down your throat. We reject such an absurd claim!
The Heyoun Trade Union will no longer limit hostile take-overs to the economic sector. The Grand King wishes to expand! There is war now!
MAJOR3:
Consider yourself fortunate to be allowed to do trade with the Khaoron Empire. Your merchantships are permitted to pass our borders.
There is nothing more honorable than true friendship between warriors. So be it then, we agree!
So shall it be! Our Empires will work together from now on.
The Khaoron High Council has granted your request for military affiliation. Nothing can stop this alliance from ruling the galaxy!
Present borders are acceptable. Violations, however, will not be tolerated!
Whoever challenges this pact, will face the wrath of the Khaoron Empire!
Those cowards have been messing with us for too long now. This war pact will teach them a lesson in fear!
The High Council will comply this time with your unfounded demand. You will make up a more interesting enemy that way...
Why should the Empire trade with you? The trust of a Khaoron warrior is not a sales option!
You are not our friends! Why sign such a treaty?
Your race is weak! The Khaoron Empire never cooperates with scum like you!
Your wish for an alliance was presented to the High Council where it has been turned down! The Empire needs no such treaty.
We will never let us be taken the right to self-defense by anyone. A non-aggression treaty is therefore not an option.
The Khaoron forces will crush everyone themselves who dares to attack the Empire! If your troops are not even capable of defending themselves, then this is not our problem. There will be no treaty of non-aggression.
This pact of war is dishonorable! Proud Khaoron warriors never approve such an intriguing action!
Let me give you an advice: Do not to get on our Chancellor's nerves that much! Worlds have been conquered for minor reasons!
You antagonised the wrong empire. We will gladly fulfil your wish to die!
MAJOR4:
Your merchantships are henceforth permitted to navigate into the territory of the Rotharian Star Network.
Not many can call themselves friends of the Rotharian Empire. You will belong to them from this day on.
A cooperation at the military sector seems worth aspiring for at the present situation. The Praetor has signed the treaty.
Your proposal of alliance was - despite some doubts expressed by our secret service - accepted.
We will not enter your territory. You will do good to do the same.
This defense treaty will further strengthen our power! Whoever opposes us, will fail!
This pact of war will determine the fate of our enemies. They will not even know what hit them.
Your will has been respected, this time. However it will not remain without consequences..
We cannot accept your offer. We do not want to do business with people like you.
The power of the Rotharian Star Network does not found itself on subordinate friendship treaties!
We do not know what came to your mind in thinking that the Rotharian Star Network will cooperate with you. Such an agreement is simply nonsense.
An alliance between our worlds is useless and worthless withal.
After examining secret service reports we have come to deny this treaty of non-aggression.
Our Empire does not need such an obligation! We will not take part in this undertaking.
Such a war pact is anything but in our advantage. The Empire will contact you at a later time if needed.
Your request has been processed. Do not expect further reaction!
This was your last mistake! You will soon be part of the Rotharian Star Network!
MAJOR5:
Trade between our systems has been cleared.
This friendship shall mark the beginning of a new era! You can be proud of this agreement.
The Cartare Union has approved military cooperation. Our battle squadrons and troops stand ready for joint strike maneuvres.
This alliance will reset the balance of power in this quadrant! Our enemies will not be able to offer resistance for too long.
Our patrols have been advised to secure borders between our territories. Current status quo will be acknowledged.
Parts of our elite squadrons have been assigned to safeguard your systems in case of need. The defense pact is hereby enacted!
Corresponding invasion plans had already been prepared by the Cartare Order in advance. All forces of the Cartare Union have been set to high alert and are ready to strike against the enemy!
We will accept your demand. Our secret service has been assigned with appropriate countermeasures.
The Cartare Union will not agree to any economic relationship between our worlds. Intercepted trade ships will be confiscated and all crews imprisoned for an indefinite period of time.
The Cartare Union has no interest in your friendship.
A military cooperation is out of question. Cartar's forces continue to operate independently.
We see no strategic advantage in such an alliance. We are strong enough to assert our claims independently!
A non-aggression pact is unnecessary. With appropriate demeanour, you will have nothing to fear from us for the time being.
If you are not able to safeguard your systems then engage some watchmen!
Cartar is not interested in such a pact at the moment. Your proposal will however be further examined by the corresponding sections.
You should recall whom you address your unfounded demands to!
You will pay your presumptions with your lives! The few survivors of your race will soon subject themselves to the Cartare Union.
MAJOR6:
The Omega-Alliance always values intensifying contact to the races of this quadrant. This trade agreement is the perfect beginning of a new kind of relationship.
In the name of the Vi, I shall welcome you as friends of the Omega-Alliance.
Our Rok'Hanar-Fleets were advised to cooperate with your forces. The corresponding treaty has already been signed by the Vi.
The Omega-Alliance welcomes this proposal of alliance. Together, we will be the predominating power in this section of the galaxy.
The Vi have decided to acknowledge our present borders. We will advise our pilots to avoid your territory.
This pact will strengthen both our strategic positions. Only fools will dare to challenge us.
Our Rok'Hanar forces have already received their marching orders. Let us divide the plunder thereafter.
Your demand seems appropriate to the Vi. We will arrange with this for the time being.
The Omega-Alliance does not depend on you as its trade partner. We do not concur with your draft.
The Vi do not need further friends.
The Rok'Hanar will only follow the Vi! A military cooperation is out of question.
The Vi see nothing in an alliance between our worlds. The Omega-Alliance will triumph without your contribution.
The Omega-Alliance preserves itself the right to do correcting interventions into the balance of power in this quadrant. A non-aggression pact is therefore not possible.
Our armada is fully able to take care of the well-being of the Vi! Your defense treaty is irrelevant for us.
This war pact does not comply with the expansion plans of the Vi! It will not be signed.
You dare to insult the Vi by such a claim? Keep it low from now on and let this reprimand be a reminder for what other options we can take in these cases!
You have messed with a power that is beyond your control! The Vi will be victorious like in the hundreds of times before you.
