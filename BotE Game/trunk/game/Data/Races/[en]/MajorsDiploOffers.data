MAJOR1:
The Coalition of Planets hereby offers to enter into trade relations with your people. This could be the beginning of a new friendship.
It is obvious that our relations go beyond mere trade. Accept our offer of friendship to strenghten our relations!
Let us work together in the military sector as well! A co-operation ensures safety for both of us!
We hereby offer your people to join the Coalition in an alliance. Such a union will give us both great advantages!
We present you an opportunity to become a member of the Coalition of Planets. Join us! There is still much we can learn from each other!
War is root of all evils! Sign this non-agression treaty, so that peace in the galaxy is preserved.
For our mutual safety for our territories we propose a defence pact. We will stand by your side, no matter who is the enemy! Can we equally rely on you?
This is a dark day for galactic peace. War has become inevitable. Join us against $enemy$ in this war! Let us bring this conflict quickly to an end!
We can no longer tolerate your actions! After mature deliberation there is no other option. We are forced to declare war on your people!
Know that no one will be able to match with the Coalition of Planets. This financial aid of the amount of $credits$ credits should clarify this. Can we count on you?
To condone your actions we demand $credits$ credits $ressource$! If you wish to maintain contact with us we expect an immediate transfer!
In order to extend our diplomatic relations even further we present you a gift of $credits$ credits!
MAJOR2:
Trade is the offspring of all! Sign this trade agreement between our peoples and I guarantee you highest profits for both sides!
It pleases us to finally offer friendship to a well-known trade partner. Shake hands with us so we can further intensify our well-going relationship.
What do you think of a military cooperation? Let our fleets do work together to increase their effectivity and power significantly.
Make profit with the Heyoun Trade Union. A cooperation on all levels will not hurt any of us, quite the contrary. Join us!
We offer you to join the evergrowing trade area of the Heyoun Trade Union. Become a part of us and enjoy the prosperity and growth of our worlds.
Peace is good for profit! You know that as well. Therefore the Heyoun Trade Union offer you a non-aggression agreement. Take it to create a stable ground for future business relations.
We should mutually protect our current estates. Let us seal this with a non-aggression treaty between our worlds. Be it that no one could ever contest our wealth.
Develop new markets together with the Heyoun Trade Union. Let us move together against our $enemy$. They will not have anything to oppose us.
Your value for the Heyoun Trade Union tends towards zero. After being destroyed you will not cause losses on our side anymore to the least. There is war now between our people. War is good for business.
Nobody can keep up with the wealth of the Heyoun Trade Union. In order to make that clear for you we transfer the amount of $credits$ credits. What do you want more? The Heyoun are expecting you!
We demand a financial gift of $credits$ credits $ressource$! If you have no interest in a rich foe you should give in to our demand.
To further strengthen our relationship we decided to let you participate in our wealth. Find delight in this gift of $credits$ credits.
MAJOR3:
The Khaoron Empire grants your people the ability to establish economic relationships with us. Your trade ships would be entitled to enter Khaoron space from now on.
Nothing beats the friendship of true warriors. Let us become friends and seal this with an appropriate treaty between our people.
We offer you the opportunity to cooperate with the glorious fleet of the Khaoron Empire. Nothing will put up with our joint military forces!
Join our mighty Empire! Not many are allowed to the position to cooperate with the Khaorons at all scales! Be aware of this honor!
Our people presents you the honourable possibility to become a member of the glorious Khaoron Empire with equal rights. Join our side and you will become a part of us!
Even if death on the battlefield marks an honor for every Khaoron, we offer you the opportunity to sign a non-aggression pact with the Khaoron Empire!
With this pact you will have a mighty protector. We will punish with death all who dare to attack you if your warriors in turn destroy every fool who raises arms against the Empire.
Side-by-side, brothers! Come with us in our glorious journey, spilling the blood of the $enemy$ in the dawn of the battle and a place at Korok'hor will be held free for you.
The Khaoron High Council decided the destruction of your empire. Do not grieve, our warriors will grant you an honourable death on the battlefield! Die in honor!
Do not line up with the weak! The Khaoron Empire is a much more important power. $credits$ credits are only a tiny part of our true strength. Join the side of the strong and powerful!
The Khaoron Empire demands $credits$ credits $ressource$ from you. There have been others who conducted the mistake to decline our demands. About your refusal however one can only read about in history books.
Since credits are more of worth for you than strength the High Council decided to present you a gift of $credits$ credits. Take it! Perhaps by that you recognize the power of the Empire!
MAJOR4:
Please note the greetings of the Rotharian Star Network. We should establish an economic relationship in terms of a trade agreement between our worlds.
A friendly approach between our worlds cannot be denied. Sign this friendship treaty to facilitate a further intensifying of our relationship!
The Rotharian Senate decided to submit a draft treaty about a military cooperation of our forces to you. Bear the tactical advantages of such a cooperation in mind carefully.
We should expand the cooperation of our worlds to every extent. On the military as well as the political stage exist possibilities to intensify them further. Join the Rotharian Star Network!
Become a part of the Rotharian Star Network! We offer you the chance to join us. Become a part of a power which cannot be opposed by anyone!
A war would be of no use for anyone in this situation. Sign this non-aggression treaty to exclude any military confrontation between our people!
The mutual safeguarding of both our territories should be sealed by treaty from now on. The Rotharian Star Network hereby offers you a non-aggression pact! Do not let this chance slip away!
$enemy$ and those fools who lined up their side did stand in both our way long enough. Follow us in the war against these enemies of our empires!
Our Praetor and the Rotharian Senate have come to decide the extermination of your race off the galaxy. Prepare for your downfall. Both our worlds are now at war!
You should reflect again the choice of your partners! This little attentiveness worth of $credits$ credits should convince you of us being the right partner for you!
You certainly do not mind to send us $credits$ credits $ressource$ with respect to keep up our diplomatic relationships. We count on your intelligence and wisdom not to decline this demand.
The Rotharian Star Network is always concerned about strengthening the relationship towards our partners. In order to support our friendship too, we send you this small gift of $credits$ credits.
MAJOR5:
The Cartare Union is interested in an economic relationship with your people. We start with proposing a trade agreement between our worlds.
Make friends with the Cartare Union! We hereby submit a corresponding treaty to you and hope on a quick and positive response from your side.
The fleets of our worlds should both commit to joint tactical exercises. Furthermore we should expand this cooperation to the whole military sector!
Our worlds should, aside from our diplomatic relationships, also interact more intensively on all other sectors. Join this Union!
With this treaty you receive the option to be part of the Cartare Union. Join us and benefit from our power!
The Cartare Union has no interest whatsoever in a military conflict with your world. We therefore propose a non-aggression pact between our empires.
We should protect each other! A defense alliance would be an ideal arrangement in this situation. Our forces stand ready for your defense. Are yours capable of performing such a task likewise?
Let us crush the enemies of our worlds together! Fight alongside us against $enemy$! Our joint fleets will have easy bargaining with them.
The Cartare Union has overlooked your world's activities long enough. It is time now to put an end to this. Count on our troops' arrival soon. We have war now!
We will give you the good advise to rethink the choice of your allies one more time. $credits$ credits should trigger enough thinking.
The Cartare Union demands $credits$ credits $ressource$! Otherwise relationships will decrease massively between our worlds and you would be losing a lot more than we.
We intend to make your people happier with this little gift of $credits$ credits. We hope to further strengthen the relationship of our peoples.
