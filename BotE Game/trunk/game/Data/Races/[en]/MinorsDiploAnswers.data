These conditions are unacceptable. We cannot accept this treaty.
The reaction of our people was everything but positive. Signing this treaty is not an option.
Your offer was not able to withstand a test our military advisors came up with. Therefore, military co-operation will not come into being under these circumstances.
An alliance does not lie the slightest within our goals. So unfortunately we must reject the offer.
Why should we join you? We do not desire a membership with you at this time.

You are of higher value to us then our past contracts. We accept your offer.
The value of such an agreement is not worth the trouble. We won't accept this deal.
The financial return of such an agreement is more then disputed, according to our experts. We cannot accept this treaty.
We don't see any reason we should carry the costs of joined military operations. We do not need a co-operation treaty.
An alliance with you equals a financial catastrophe. The offer was unanimously rejected.
We are not in the slightest enticed to consider a membership with you. We will remain self-sufficient!
Betraying our partners would simply cost us too much money as it is! No deal!
We just tripled our military defense budget. You don't stand a chance!
WARLIKE:
All profits from this trade relation will help us directly with our troop support costs. We accept.
There is nothing wrong with having powerful friends. We are proud to call you friends.
This co-operation will significantly increase the battle strenght of our forces! Our armada is ready.
The new power which will result from this alliance will be unmatched! Nobody will be able to stop us.
We are honored to become part of your armed forces. We join your empire at once!
Our former partners have lost most of their previous strenght. They've become weak! We will no longer follow them.
We will not sign any trade agreement. You must first earn our confidence!
We are not your friends!
Our armed forces are not dependant on your auxiliary troops! This pact is an insult!
This alliance will forever remain a dream to you!
If we decide to annex your territory, we will simply take it! This offer is a joke!
I advise you to keep such bribery to yourself! You won't like the consequences!

INDUSTRIAL:
We are quite interested in an economic relationship between our worlds. our industry needs a steady supply of resources.
From our point of view nothing stands in the way of friendlier relations.
Our most prominent arms companies agreed to a military co-operation. Our fleet is available for joined maneuvers.
This alliance will allow our industry to continue to expand. The treaty is accepted at once.
Our productivity will increase to a point where to this day we were only able to dream off. Our people are ready to join you.
We will probably reconsider our contracts in light of what you offered.

We hive no time for such useless agreements.
We are quite able to substantially increase our troop contingents in a short period of time. We do not need a military pact with your people.

SECRET:
Our sources tell us to expect profits to come from such an arrangement. We accept.
This friendship treaty could develop to the advantage of both sides. You can convey our agreement.

This alliance will expand our influence substantially. At the moment nothing speaks against us signing this deal.
Membership in your empire would continue to improve our position in the sector. We will join you.
Our partners will never learn why our treaties were cancelled.
We know all about your trade momevements. They pose no interest to us.
Why should we call you friends? We don't need any friends!
A large fleet is not the only way to secure dominance in this quadrant. Your request is rejected.
Our influence is cleary already larger than yours. Such an alliance is not advantagous to us.
We will continue to operate self-sufficiently. A membership right now is completely out of the question!
Our intelligence services had to work hard for this partnership. We will simply not risk breaking it.
We expected your declaration of war. Your troops wil fail.

This agreement will help us increase our research budget. We accept.
A friendship agreement is the next logical step to intensify our partnership. We accept.
Through this co-operation, we will be able to divert our attention to more important projects.
Many historic breakthroughs were the result of scientists who decided to collaborate with other scientists. We agree to this alliance with joy in our hearts.
The possibilities of a membership and the accompanying union of our research departments are endless! We will join you.
Our present partnership does not help our people advance. We will probably direct ourselves to others.

We are not yet ready to share all of our knowledge with you. We like to remain independent for the time being.

yes, the co-operation of our worlds should intensify. An alliance is exactly what is needed.
A membership is quite worthwile for our people. We are pleased to communicate to you that the offer is accepted.
Their offer was not easily rejected. May our new relationship be more productive.
My people live in abundance. A trade agreement is not desirable.
We believe we do quite without such an agreement.
Military collaboration is not conceivable at this moment. We must reject your proposal.
An alliance with your people? We do not strive for such close collaboration at this time. Our government must reject.
Our people are quite fond to be in a position where we control our own fate. We will not join you.
We are not the type to treat our partners with betrayal. Now we know what to expect of you.

PACIFIST:
May this represent the beginning of a long peaceful relationship between our worlds. It is a joy to sign this trade agreement.
There is no higher goal then peace. This friendship treaty will in the long-term contribute to securing peace in this part of the galaxy.
This co-operation will further stabilize this sector. Let us secure the peace together.
This alliance will shine as a bright example. After us many more races will follow!
We have decided to completely join your empire. This way war will never again afflict our people.
Peace means nothing to our partner. We are clearly far more in harmony with your people!
Our government has no interest in such an agreement. It would wrong us.
WE do not seem to pursue the same interests. We cannot discuss a friendship treaty at this time.
We do not care for military co-operation, if it would only serve the security of our borders nominally. Joint military operations are out of the question.
A closer collaboration with your people contradicts our goal to preserve neutrality in this sector. We must decline.
We decided to continue to the process of peace independently with the skills of our people. Unfortunately we must decline your proposal.
At last you show your true face! We will never betray our partners!
Your weapons can destroy our cities, but you will never break our spirits!
SNEAKY:
At the moment this deal seems to bring certain advantages with it. We are inclined to accept your proposal.
At the right moment, a friendship treaty can represent an enormous strategic advantage. We accept.
This co-operation will teach our enemies to fear us. None will be able to withstand the combined strenght of our worlds.
An alliance between our worlds seems extremely useful. We will extend our co-operation.
Under your leadership our people will shine in a greater light.
We were already tired of their failures. Your offer makes terminating this troublesome treaty all the easier.
We believe you have far less to offer us then we you. A trade agreement is therefore unwise.
Frienship is overrated. Further, we are not friends! There will be no friendship treaty between us.
We do not need your troops. We will continue to act on our own.
We are not convinced an alliance with you would benefit us when your actions speak the opposite!
A membership? That's ridiculous!
Our partners still have their uses for the moment. We will remain faithful to them at this time.
I see you have overrated your own abilities again. This venture is as pointless as your requests for mercy will be!
