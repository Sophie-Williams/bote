Ionizing Gas Entity
This strange life form is relatively harmless and only defends itself when it is irritated e.g. with LASER beams. But it also reacts when it comes in touch with a planet, which can result in severe weather phenomena and natural disasters.

Gaballian
The unarmed plague ship carries a virus which is multiresistant and transmissible in vacuum. Everything which comes in contact with the virus will be infected and contaminated. Ships which get too close to them will fall under control of the Gaballians, which are themselves under control of the virus. They are searching for a permanent home.

Boseans:
Boseans
These small creatures are relatively peaceful as long as they are not foraging or under attack. They possess strong shields and can digest hostile ships. In this way they are multiplying, giving birth to a new Bosean of the same type as the destroyed ship.
