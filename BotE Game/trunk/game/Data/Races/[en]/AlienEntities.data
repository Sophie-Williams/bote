Ionisierendes Gaswesen:
Ionizing Gas Entity
This strange life form is relatively harmless and only defends itself when it is irritated e.g. with LASER beams. But it also reacts when it comes in touch with a planet, which can result in severe weather phenomena and natural disasters.

Boseaner:
Boseans
These small creatures are relatively peaceful as long as they are not foraging or under attack. They possess strong shields and can digest hostile ships. In this way they are multiplying, giving birth to a new Bosean of the same type as the destroyed ship.

Rammschiff:
Rammschiff
The ramship is an anaerobic Macrob with an organic continuum drive. It frequently rams and phagocytoses ships and their occupants, but it is afraid of large planets and stars. Therefore it is, if at all, only in small stellar systems with green stars. One ship can only cause minor damage, but many of them are dangerous.
