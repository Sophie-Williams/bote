Weapons Technology
It becomes ever clearer that our continued interstellar expansion is associated with substantial risks. Ever to be prepared for all eventualities, a significant increase in the defense budget has been allocated from our resources. The strategists of our military voted unanimously that the resources should be spent on the further development of the offensive abilities of our ships. The improved spending on our military infrastructure will not only improve the capability of the whole fleet, but will also act as a deterrent to hostile races.
+30% Laser Power
+25% Torpedo Accuracy
+20% Increased Rate of Fire
By remodulating the resonant frequency of the Antium particle stream in Laser emitters, the effective energy output can be substantially increased. This improvement can improve Laser penetration by 30% or more.
By concentrating our research efforts on the targeting systems for our Torpedo Launchers, we could optimize target acquisition. This research could improve the accuracy of our launch systems by 25%.
The next generation of weapons systems will be possible with this technology. By increasing the size of the Laser capacitors on board ships of the fleet, our vessels will be able to fire their Lasers more often per firing cycle. New Torpedo launch systems also promise improved load time and target acquisition locks. These improvements will increase the rate of fire of our vessels by as much as 20%.
Construction technology
Cosmic radiation, small meteorites, and the increasing threat of unfriendly races make a continuous improvement in the passive protection mechanisms of our vessels essential. These technologies increase the energy absorption potential of our defense systems, allowing the vessel to withstand much greater impact damage.
+20% Shielding
+20% Hull Impact Strength
+50% Enhanced Sensors
Equipping our vessels with the latest generation in Micro-Fusion Generators would provide the energy needed to boost the shield matrices of the fleet. With this technology, our vessels will be able to withstand sustained damage for longer periods of time, improving the survivability of the fleet by as much as 20% in combat situations.
The power relays to the structural integrity fields of our vessels have been identified as a potential weakness in the fleet. Improving the capacity of the relays will allow our engineers to include more powerful integrity fields in the design of both current and future ships. This technology could increase the hull strength of our vessels by as much as 20%.
The Subspace distortion caused by the Continuum fields of Continuum-capable vessels is confined to a few select frequencies. This technology automatically monitors sensor data for spikes in these select frequencies, then triangulates their source. This technology will improve both sensor accuracy and range, effectively giving officers more time to react to incoming threats.
General Starship Technology
Our borders continue to steadily expand, making the efficient control and distribution of supplies ever more vital. In order to guarantee supplies are distributed evenly throughout our entire territory, continuous developments in production and engine efficiency are vital. These improvements can then be applied to both civilian and military interests, once approved by the appropriate authorities.
Increased Range
Increased Speed
-10% Ship Production Costs
New deritium extraction and shaping methods would allow for the creation of higher quality deritium crystals. This technology would allow our low-range vessels to travel for longer periods of time without requiring engine maintenance and replacement crystals, effectively extending the range of this part of our fleet.
Recent progress in Continuum theory has brought the development of newer, faster, more efficient engines closer. Developing the theories into working models would allow us to refit our slowest vessels with better engines. Projections estimate this will double the effective speed of these ships.
The increasing need for parts for constructing our fleets is beginning to strain our resources. Developing new production techniques would allow us to produce these parts more easily, speeding construction by as much as 10%.
Peaceful Ship Technology
Numerous innovations in various military disciplines could also be of benefit to civilian space travel. Both prominent representatives of the economy and high-ranking military officials are discussing how best these advancements could be used. These technologies are the fruits of their discussions.
+25% Cargo Capacity
No Maintenance Costs
-25% Ship Production Costs
Our Cargo transportation systems are rapidly becoming obsolete. By redesigning the internal spaces of our ships and employing the latest in miniaturised systems, more cargo space could be achieved. Better storage technology will also increase the preservation of special cargoes.
According to our analysts, developing and employing new maintenance procedures on our non-combat ships and reducing the size of maintenance crews could effectively eliminate the maintenance cost of the fleet.
As civilian production operations continue to shift the economic forces within our territory, the production costs of the military are starting to spiral out of control. Our analysts believe that by employing some of these businesses to produce the parts needed for constructing the fleet, we could effectively reduce our build costs by 25%.
Troops
Great progress in the range of military vessel components has recently been achieved, but without well-trained troops and crew, these developments are useless. These technologies will allow our Infantry to match these improvements on the battlefield.
+20% Planetary Combat Capability
Improves Basic Training
-20% Troop Production Costs
Offense is the best defense. By shifting the tactical emphasis of our troops to preventive impacts against hostile positions and equipping our landing forces with the last generation of heavy Laser rifles, the survivability of our troops will be greatly improved.
More realistic training and the training in many different combat situations would better prepare our troops for deployment. This would ensure that even raw recruits will be able to handle combat situations like seasoned veterans.
we last to By completely restructuring our entire military infrastructure and more effectivly recruiting troops, the costs of educating our infantry could be decreased by as much as 20%.
Economy
Focusing our economic forces on key areas would allow for greater economic growth and improvements in industry, which would benefit both the military and civilian interests.
+10% Industrial Capacity
-5% Construction Costs
+25% Finances
By employing the latest in Mass-Replication technologies in our industrial interests, we could greatly increase our industrial capacity. Estimates put the increase at 110% of current industrial capacity.
It has long been known that transportation costs are one the greatest costs in industry. Whilst energy intensive and expensive to install, utilising the latest in Transporter technology would help to reduce overall transportation costs by up to 5%.
Reforming our finances and rearranging financial transactions on all systems within our sphere of influence would boost the income on our receipts by 25%.
Production
In industry, the development of new technologies is only useful if those technologies can be of use outside of the laboratory. Without the infrastructure in place to to support these new technologies, the pace of our development will slow and eventually stagnate. Improving our industrial infrastructure would provide benefits to Industrial processes through our Empire.
+15% Food Production
+5% Resource Production
+20% Energy Production
Innovative new developments in Genetics have made further improvement in the quality and production of food sources possible. Further development in this field could increase our food production by 15%.
Industrial-sized Transporters and automated ore processors could be employed in the production or vital ores. Further development of these new systems would increase the production or raw materials by 5%.
Traditional cooling systems often rely on super-cooled liquids or gases to ensure the energy core is sufficiently controlled to minimise the risk of a meltdown, but these substances are often harmful to the environment and are difficult to produce. The development of cheaper, more effective coolants would allow the production of higher core temperatures, increasing our maximum safe energy production by as much as 20%, and would simultaneously reduce the risk of leakage to the environment.
Development and Security
Our continued development is attracting the unwelcome attention of spies from both within and without our territory. To ensure our secrets do not fall into the hands of our economic and military enemies, continued improvements in security must also be made. These advancements will help to reduce the threat of unwanted attention.
+10% Research Empire-Wide
+10% Internal Security
+5% Research and Internal Security
Our Scientists require the latest technology to ensure they can perform their vital work. Providing them with the most advanced computers currently available would give them the tools to test their theories.
Communications are vital. If our agents are unable to communicate with their contacts and superiors, they will be unable to catch spies and terrorists. Developing a new, secure communication system would allow our spies to work more effectively.
By working together, our researchers and intelligence operatives would be able to improve developments in their respective fields. By developing these links, both development and internal security can be increased.
Research
Publicly-funded Universities have only a limited source of income for research projects,and as such, much research that could bring benefits to our Empire goes unfunded. Private sponsorship from our industrial and economic forces would put an end to this travesty, and spur research in many fields.
+20% Biology and Energy Research
+20% Computer and Propulsion Research
+20% Construction and Weapons Research
Mitochondria are the energy-production centers of most living organisms. If our Genetics and Energy experts were to work more closely together, they may be able to achieve significant advancements in both fields.
Introducing prizes for the creation of specific technologies has long been known to spur research. The Nobel and Zee-Magnees prizes are two examples of prizes that have spurred research in many different fields. The introduction of such a prize specifically aimed at the introduction of new Computer and Propulsion technologies could vastly increase developments in the respective fields.
The military and construction research and industries have a long tradition of working together. If the surplus resources from the defense budget were used to bolster our construction efforts, these ties could be further improved, and would provide funding for a great many projects.
Security
According to our strategists, direct military threats are not the only threat to our society. Enemy spies and saboteurs present an equal threat, and should be treated as so. Reorganising our internal security arrangements and increasing the defense budget would go a long way towards eliminating this threat.
+20% Internal Security
+20% Sabotage Success
+20% Espionage Success
Introducing more advanced encryption technology and better communication between departments would have tangible benefits for our security operatives. Introducing these measures would ensure our secrets remain secret.
Surgical modification is an area of research that has come a long way in a short time. By surgically modifying their appearance, our operatives would have better disguises to fool enemy security patrols, increasing the success rate of our sabotage attempts against enemy installations.
The development of microtape storage devices allowed our agents to gather and record information far more quickly than previously possible. However, this technology is quickly reaching the end of its usefulness, as the amounts of data that our agents are procuring is increasing exponentially. Developing new devices with greater storage capacity and the latest in communication and encryption technology would help to increase the success of our espionage attempts.
Storage and transport
By a reorientation of our storage handlings and the internal transport systems, we are now capable of receiving enormous advantages of that.
double Deritium storage
no interstellar storage room penalty
one additional resource route
New containment fields increase the liability and security of Deritium storage. With that we are capable of storing double the amount of Deritium.
Optimizing transport routes and a better protection from raids lowers costs enormously. With these techniques we won't have to mourn any further losses during trade.
An optimization or our transport network would simplify storaging goods on various systems. Therefore we would be able to build a more dense network.
Trade
Our best financeers and stock-broker have gathered to think about an improvement of our aging trade system. After some time, they have found a solution that allows us to make more profits at the same costs.
no commissions
+30% lower monopoly costs
at least one trade route per system
By channeling in our own stock-brokers at the global stock exchange, we would be capable of circumventing the usual broker's charges.
Our best economic experts have studied the global exchange a bit deeper. By this newly-gathered knowledge we would be able to obtain a trade monopoly at significantly lower costs.
By the increased inclusion of the population in the interstellar trade, we could establish trade routes even in small systems. Bigger systems are not affected by this new regulation.
Finances
Tuning individual financial markets to optimal would ensure waste is minimised and growth is maximised. These improvements would lead to greater financial returns on our investments and a reduction in risk.
-5% Purchase Costs
-10% Maintenance Costs
+35% Taxes In Home System
By bulk-buying parts and systems, we can negotiate discounts and deals when buying new equipment. We could achieve approximately a 5% reduction or more in costs if we bought goods in this manner.
By introducing construction materials that are more durable and less prone to corrosion, we can reduce our maintenance costs by as much as 10%. This would more than negate the increased construction costs of using such materials.
The home system is our industrial and economic power-house. By assessing all companies and individuals for taxes on a more regualr basis, we will be able to ensure that all taxes owed are paid in full.
