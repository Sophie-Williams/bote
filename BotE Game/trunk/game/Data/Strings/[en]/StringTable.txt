[TRADEOVERVIEW_IN]
System trade in

[CLASS_A_INFO]
Small, young worlds with surfaces that are usually molten with possible volcanic activity. Atmospheres, if any, would be very thin. This is similar to the moon Io.

[CLASS_B_INFO]
Young planets that are larger than Class A. They have partially molten surfaces and active volcanoes. Atmospheres, if any, are very thin. In our real solar system Mercury may be considered a Class B planet.

[CLASS_C_INFO]
Young planets that are geologically inactive, (hence their name), and may be covered in ice and/or frozen gases. In our real solar system Pluto could be considered a Class C planet.

[CLASS_E_INFO]
Small, young and volcanically active worlds still in the process of forming. Their surfaces are largely molten.

[CLASS_F_INFO]
Very young worlds with volcanically active surfaces with heavy metallic cores rich in ores and minerals making them valuable to mining conglomerates. If any life develops it may be silicon-based.

[CLASS_G_INFO]
Young, but large worlds, with surfaces that are still solidifying. Their atmospheres may contain carbon dioxide and other toxic gases. If there is any life present it would be limited to primitive single-celled organisms.

[CLASS_H_INFO]
Desert worlds with barren surfaces that are either hot and arid, (if in close orbit of the parent star) or covered with icy tundra if in a more distant orbit. Life forms developing on such a world would have to be resilient to either extreme hot or cold temperatures and if the planet is close to the star, resistant to solar radiation.

[CLASS_I_INFO]
Gas Supergiants, over 140,000 km in diameter. They are comprised almost entirely hydrogen and helium, but may contain water vapor as well. They may contain a solid metallic mass core and radiate heat. They can have hundreds of moons and also water ice rings. Many extrasolar planets discovered in real life could be classified as Class I Supergiants.

[CLASS_J_INFO]
Gas Giants less than 140,000 km in diameter. They are mainly comprised of hydrogen and helium gases and could have a solid rocky or metallic core. They can have many moons as well as water ice rings. In real life, Jupiter and Saturn could be Class J planets.

[CLASS_K_INFO]
Rocky and barren with little, if any, surface water. Their atmospheres are thin, and comprise mostly carbon dioxide. Life forms, if any, are limited to single-celled organisms and algae. They are "adaptable" because through terraforming they are suitable for human colonization. In real life, Mars could be considered a Class K planet.

[CLASS_L_INFO]
Rocky, barren surfaces with little water. Their atmospheres are mainly oxygen and argon with a high concentrations of carbon dioxide. Life forms, if any, would be limited to simple plant life. Class L planets are suitable for human colonization with some terraforming.

[CLASS_M_INFO]
Always located in the ecological region of a star where they are provided enough warmth and energy to develop and sustain carbon-based life. Their surfaces comprises a thin tectonic layer floating on a molten rock mantle and they usually have many active volcanoes. Most importantly, they have plenty of liquid water necessary for life to exist. Their atmospheres contain oxygen and nitrogen with other gas traces. Life forms are almost always present, often flourishing as extensive plant and animal life.

[CLASS_N_INFO]
Barren and rocky with extremely high surface temperatures caused by an intense greenhouse effect. Their atmospheres are extremely dense comprising mainly carbon dioxide and corrosive sulfides. Sometimes water vapor is present. Life would be limited to single-celled organisms living in the upper layers of atmosphere. In our real solar system, Venus could be a Class N planet. Some Class N planets may also fall into Class X, Y, or Z Demon planets, especially if a bizarre form of life exists on them.

[CLASS_O_INFO]
Similar to Class M worlds but over 80% of their surface is covered in water. Life forms would mainly be aquatic in nature.

[CLASS_P_INFO]
Similar to Class O water planets with an abundance of surface water, however almost all of it is locked in frozen ice. Liquid water may be present under the ice but at extreme depths. Any life developing on the surface would have to adapt to extremely frigid conditions. In real life, the Jovian moons Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede could be considered Class P planets.

[CLASS_Q_INFO]
Variable surface conditions because they either orbit a variable output star, (where energy levels fluctuate), or they exist in an extremely elongated orbit passing very close then falling away to an extreme distance from the star. Variable conditions can also be caused by some other effect, either natural or artificial. The result is an extremely harsh world where temperatures rise and fall to extreme levels. Any life existing on such a world would have to be extremely adaptable to rapid climate changes.

[CLASS_R_INFO]
Class R, or rogue planets, do not orbit stars. Instead, they float in the cold darkness of space. They most likely normally formed within a solar system but have been flung deep into space usually caused by the collision with another planetary body. The surface of a rogue planet would usually be barren, but some might be temperate due to geothermal venting with atmospheres filled with volcanic gases. Life would be rare, but some may have unusual life that gather near volcanic regions.

[CLASS_S_INFO]
Super Gas Giants or brown dwarfs. Their diameters range in size from 50 to 100 thousand km. They radiate considerable heat and generate enormous amounts of gravity, often harboring hundreds or even thousands of moons. In most cases, these moons would be subject to considerable tidal forces and gravitational effects caused by their parent planet.

[CLASS_T_INFO]
"Near star" planets are Super Gas Giants or brown dwarfs with diameters from 100 to 200 thousand km. Any larger and they would be classified as stars. They radiate considerable heat and generate enormous amounts of gravity, often harboring hundreds or even thousands of moons. In most cases, these moons would be subject to considerable tidal forces and gravitational effects caused by their parent planet.

[CLASS_Y_INFO]
Classes Y is reserved for strange planets referred to as "Demon" worlds where surface conditions do not fall into any other recognized category. Such worlds are usually hostile and lethal to humanoid life. If life develops on these worlds they usually take on many bizarre forms, like living crystal or rock, liquid or gaseous physical states, non-corporeal or dimensional states or be energy-based.

[BLUE_STAR_DESC]
These so-called hypergiants exceed yellow or green stars many times over in size. They are by far the massiest stars and with up to a hundredfold mass and with tausend- to millionfold luminosity of that of yellow stars the brightest stars of the galaxy.
[GREEN_STAR_DESC]
Stars of this type are mostly not recognizable as such in the first place since they are "shining" in other colors or leveled white. Only in binary star system their true color is revealed. In terms of size they are quite similar to yellow stars. With modern scanners however accurate display is no longer an issue.
[ORANGE_STAR_DESC]
Red dwarves are all red orange color and make up for at least 70% of all stars in the milky star. Thus it is a quite common star in the universe, but certainly completely different to their red giants color-wise counterpart. Red dwarves weigh between one-tenth and a half of the mass of a yellow  star and also possess only a small luminosity on their surface.
[RED_STAR_DESC]
Red giants belong to the most voluminous, brightest but also "coolest" stars in the galaxy. They are settled in their last stage of existence bevor they detach their outer particle atmosphere and shrink down to become a white dwarf or a black hole if large enough.
[VIOLET_STAR_DESC]
This type was only recently discovered with the development of continuum drives making it possible to detect them on-site with their short-range high-uv radiation, mostly belted by thick layers of datter matter fields. They are pretty variable, but all have a young star age in common.
[WHITE_STAR_DESC]
B, A and F stars of stellar classification radiate in white-blue spectrum and count to the largest representatives of their species. On average they are about twice as hot as yellow stars and three times as heavy.
[YELLOW_STAR_DESC]
Yellow stars are considered to be favorable for the development of life because they represent stable middle-class stars with rather constant environmental conditions.

[RADIONEBULA_DESC]
Radioactive nebulae are dense clusters of instable atomic nuclei. They can be ripped out of their metastable state when a ship is entering such a nebula and decay releasing a high amount energy. Organic lifeforms will suffer instant death after shield collapsing.
[METNEBULA_DESC]
A Meaturean nebula consists of high amounts of electromagnetic ion particels. Their discharge destabilizes and collapses all shields.
[DEUTNEBULA_DESC]
Deuterium nebulae can be found in "near-" star systems. The gaseous deuterium releases a weak radiation harmless to organic life but impairing sensors and shields severely and puts them out of function after a while. These nebulae shine auburn by their high level of deuterium.
[IONSTORM_DESC]
Ion storms are a dangerous form of magnetic storms. Ions, i.e. charged atoms, can amplify themselves as planetary as well as deep space originated ion distortions so that navigation and communication is largely disturbed.
[BINEBULA_DESC]
Biphasic nebulae consists of biphasic elements, i.e. it contains elements in two aggregate phases as well as two spin formations. Their effect is strongly polarizing on monophasic shields improving their regenerating power.
[TORIONGASNEBULA_DESC]
A Torion gas nebula absorbs energy from shield generators and jams target locking systems of all torpedo weapons up to their complete disfunctioning. The exact mechanism of this interfering is not fully understood.
[NEUTRONSTAR_DESC]
A neutron star is a type of remnant that can result from the gravitational collapse of a massive star during a Type II, Type Ib or Type Ic supernova event. Such stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles without electrical charge and a slightly larger mass than protons. Neutron stars are very hot and are supported against further collapse because of the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states that no two neutrons (or any other fermionic particle) can occupy the same place and quantum state simultaneously.
[RADIOPULSAR_DESC]
Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit a beam of electromagnetic radiation. The radiation can only be observed when the beam of emission is pointing towards the Earth. This is called the lighthouse effect and gives rise to the pulsed nature that gives pulsars their name. Because neutron stars are very dense objects, the rotation period and thus the interval between observed pulses is very regular. For some pulsars, the regularity of pulsation is as precise as an atomic clock.
[XRAYPULSAR_DESC]
X-ray pulsars or accretion-powered pulsars are a class of astronomical objects that are X-ray sources displaying strict periodic variations in X-ray intensity. The X-ray periods range from as little as a fraction of a second to as much as several minutes.
[MAGNETAR_DESC]
A magnetar is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field, the decay of which powers the emission of copious amounts of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, particularly X-rays and gamma rays.
[GRAVDISTORTION_DESC]
A gravimetric distortion takes place in the local gravitational field. This implies that a strong gravitational force is present and can damage any ship's hull or material flying through it. Damages however are mostly not critical except for hull-weak ships.
[CONTINUUMRIP_DESC]
A continuum rip arises when enormous amounts of energy are released at a single point in time space and rips open a gap. Ships entering it are melted and destroyed in total.
[BLACKHOLE_DESC]
A black hole is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape, therefore the "black" in its name. It is the result of the deformation of spacetime caused by a very compact mass. Around a black hole there is an undetectable surface which marks the point of no return, called an event horizon. The gravity well caused by the Black Hole makes sensor readings of this sector unreliable. Ships may be destroyed if they drift too close to the event horizon but no captain in his right mind would risk such a maneuver and stays captain afterwards for that matter...
[QUASAR_DESC]
A quasi-stellar radio source ("quasar") is a very energetic and distant galaxy with an active galactic nucleus. They are the most luminous objects in the universe. Quasars were first identified as being high redshift sources of electromagnetic energy, including radio waves and visible light, that were point-like, similar to stars, rather than extended sources similar to galaxies.
[WORMHOLE_DESC]
Wormholes are spacetime shortcuts. In order for ships to cross great distances in a single move, exotic matter with negative energy density needs to be used for stabilization. Yet no one has successfully developed a working stabilizer. Also the wormhole in question needs to have distinct endpoints, if possible none of them being a black hole.
