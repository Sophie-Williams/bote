BASIC BIOTECH
Biotech represents sophistication in life sciences such as Biology or Physiology, but also Geology, Meteorology, and other planetary sciences. Terraforming and farm production are affected by this field of technology.
BASIC ENERGY
Energy technology represents advances in the generation and control of power. Its most direct benefit is in advanced power generation, but it also determines the strength and regenerative powers of starship shields.
BASIC COMPUTERS
Computers are one of the most dramatic life-improving inventions of the Electronic Age. Computer technology increases the "intelligence" of artificial devices, such as targeting systems on starships.
BASIC PROPULSION
Propulsion is the science which makes things move faster. Advances in propulsion make starships go faster and farther, through gradual improvements in efficiency and thrust capacity.
BASIC CONSTRUCTION
Construction technology represents advances in fabrication methods and architectural designs. It influences the production speed of factories as well as the durability of starships.
BASIC WEAPONS
Weapon technology is an applied physical science, primarily concerned with the large-scale rapid discharge of destructive energy. Weapons research applies to personnel-scale and starship-scale weaponry.
HYDROPONICS
Hydroponics allows plants to be grown in completely controlled environments based mostly on water. This includes the possibility of growing plants in large starships, or in habitats on alien worlds.
NUCLEAR FUSION
The need for higher energy outputs has finally been rectified with the advances in nuclear chemistry bringing about an efficient system of nuclear fusion. By combining multiple atoms into a single heavier atom, it is now possible to produce a sustainable energy reaction better able to fulfill the needs of ever increasing power outputs from civilian and military establishments.
MICROTAPE STORAGE DEVICES
These lightweight, portable storage devices carry several reels of data storage microtape, and employ integrated subprocessors to optimize data access. They allow computers to quickly locate critical data.
CONTINUUM DRIVE
The Fluctuation Superimpeller is a massive propulsion device which allows travel at the speed of light without ever remaining precisely at that speed for longer than Planck time. This technology has already come to be known colloquially as "Continuum drive".
GAMMA WELDING
Conventional welding processes partially melt the material to be welded; this side effect is unacceptable for advanced spacecraft. Gamma Welding bonds materials through nuclear interaction rather than electromagnetic stimulation.
BEAM EMITTERS
Beam emitters release destructive energy in a tight, focused beam with minimal dispersion, allowing laser-like attacks on targets thousands of kilometers distant. This advancement makes beam weapons practical for starship use.
BIONICS
Bionics are synthetic tissues which replace organics. Bionic tissues can be used to repair injuries, strengthen fragile tissues, and aid in surgical procedures.
FORCE FIELDS
Force Fields are complex polarized magnetic fields which impart inertial potential to charged particles and hence atoms. These fields may be used to move hazardous materials from a safe distance, or counteract unwanted inertial force.
LINGUISTIC INTERFACING
Linguistic Interfacing allows computers to communicate with their users in natural language. This advance allows fleet officers to reprogram starship computers at need, without extensive training in computer programming.
CONTINUUM DISTORTION PROPULSION
The first drive system to significantly exceed the speed of light, this system can propel a starship at true "Continuum" velocities. It functions by reshaping subspace around the drive system.
STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY FIELDS
Structural integrity fields allow large structures (such as starships) to be made from heavy materials without suffering the stress caused by the mass of such materials. As a result, stronger alloys may be used in all forms of construction, including the fabrication of starships.
TORPEDO HARDENING
Hardened torpedoes are encased in absorptive material that resists the effects of enemy shields. This resistance is only momentary, but allows the torpedo to detonate within the shields, rather than outside them, and thus improves overall damage.
GENETIC ARCHITECTURE
Genetic Architecture allows biologists to create living organisms whose function is generally predictable - designing DNA essentially from scratch. These bacteria can make alien soil suitable for the growth of edible plants.
SUBSPACE PHYSICS
Through acceleration, normal electromagnetic waves can be pushed over the subspace threshold. As a result, the behavior of energy in subspace bands can now be predicted and exploited.
MOLECULAR DATA IMAGING
With this technology, computers can faithfully represent physical matter as data, and use solid matter as long-term data storage. In practice, this allows a material sample to be duplicated as easily as a data file.
PLASMA INJECTION
Plasma injection involves powering Continuum field coils in short, energetic bursts. This method provides more power than older coil activation techniques, with better fine control over the shape and intensity of Continuum fields.
MONOMOLECULAR EPITAXY
Monomolecular Epitaxy allows the construction of material filaments one molecule wide. These filaments can be used independently or combined to make incredibly strong synthetic alloys.
BEAM HARDENING
Shield resistance is increased by power, but decreased by impact area. Hardened beams are fired in a convergent pattern whose cross-sectional area is vanishingly small at the point of shield impact. This reduces the effective strength of enemy shields, effectively increasing the impact strength of the beams.
METAGENICS
Metagenic technology allows scientists to create protogenetic matter which can bring life to barren ecologies. With further research, this technology could make rapid, large-scale terraforming an effective reality.
MATTER CONVERSION
Matter conversion allows matter to be converted directly to energy, and vice-versa. With powerful imaging scanners, it is conceivable that materialization could be patterned on the molecular or even the quantum level.
DUOTRONICS
Phased matter can occupy the same space as normal matter at the same time. A pair of electrons in phase opposition is colloquially called a "duotron". Duotronic computers show dramatic increases in processing speed and data bandwidth.
CONTINUUM MICRODISTORTION
The Fusion Microimpeller is a drive system which creates a small Continuum field requiring minimal energy in comparison to those used to propel starships. It can propel probes and other unmanned craft at Continuum speed without a Deritium reactor, or allow fine movement control in larger ships.
PHASE TRANSITION BONDING
Phase-transition bonding merges two pieces of material by temporarily changing the phase of one item. When the phase distortion is reversed, the two pieces are inextricably merged, and the density of their intersecting volume is doubled.
MATTER PACKETS
Torpedoes use a supply of matter and antimatter to produce an explosion. Matter packet technology allows the matter and antimatter reagents to be thoroughly mixed before containment release, providing a more efficient (and effective) detonation cycle.
CLIMATE CONTROL
Climate Control allows the weather patterns of a planet to be controlled, by harnessing and redirecting solar radiation and air pressure. This technology has immediate applications in both terraforming and farming methods.
GRAVITON PHYSICS
Gravitons are waves of gravity, just as photons are waves of light. By controlling the rate of release of gravitons from certain materials, it is now possible to create and control gravitational forces.
CRYSTAL MEMORY DEVICES
This advanced application of Molecular Data Imaging allows data to be stored in stable, solid-state crystal matrices which virtually eliminate the seek time delays of older microtape devices.
ASYMMETRICAL PERISTALTIC FIELD MANIPULATION
Instead of generating a single immense Continuum field, this technology allows Continuum nacelles to create multiple, layered fields which have a much greater cumulative effect. This reduces the overall power requirement of large Continuum fields.
NONPROPULSIVE Continuum FIELDS
Structural Integrity fields have a power requirement which increases as fast as the mass they support. Continuum Fields have stability thresholds which reduce their power needs. Nonpropulsive Continuum Fields thus provide a more efficient and more stable source of structural integrity.
MULTIFREQUENCY BEAMS
Shields are least effective when their resonance frequency is the same as the frequency of the incoming beam. Multifrequency beams operate on several simultaneous frequencies, maximizing the probability that part of the beam will match the shield harmonics and do additional shield damage.
ATMOSPHERIC CONVERSION
Atmospheric conversion allows development of machines which can change the pressure and composition of alien atmospheres. These devices can make the air of an alien world more suitable for farms and colonists.
ELECTROPLASMIC POWER DISTRIBUTION
Plasma power has always been used by Continuum engines, but advanced containment procedures now allow this same power source to be used in populated areas where massive shielding is inconvenient.
QUADRITRONICS
Modern interphasic stabilizers allow the familiar duotron to be augmented by two more electrons on a perpendicular phase axis. The resulting unit is known as a Quadritron, which has led to the use of the term "quad" as a unit of data volume.
CONTINUUM FIELD GEOMETRY
Continuum Field Geometry allows engineers to control the shape of Continuum fields, effectively reducing the field size needed by larger vessels. The design of future starships will be dictated by advances in this field.
DIFFUSION BONDING
Diffusion bonding is an advanced method of phase-transition bonding. With this method, the increased density is diffused over the entire compound rather than concentrated in the intersection volume. This method can also be used to achieve uniform density in complex alloys.
CONTINUUM GUIDANCE
Torpedoes which rely on starship tactical data for guidance cannot react as quickly as enemy ships. Continuum Guidance systems are carried on the torpedo, allowing the torpedo to lock onto an enemy vessel and home in autonomously.
BIOFILTRATION
Advances in genetics research make it possible to predict the expression of viral and bacterial specimens by direct analysis. Using this technology, biofilters can identify and eliminate harmful viral and bacterial agents in living organic tissue.
ANTIMATTER FUSION
With advanced containment procedures, antimatter can be fused into larger nuclei than the antihydrogen that is commonly used as a reactant. These larger antinuclei produce more energy per reaction, and require less containment energy.
ISOLINEAR OPTICS
Isolinear Optics, when used with chips designed for them, allow instantaneous access to solid-matter dataforms. The acceleration of data retrieval and storage achieved by these new devices renders older Crystal Memory Devices utterly obsolete.
SUPERCONDUCTIVE FIELD CONTAINERS
Superconductive Field Containers allow Deritium reactors and fuel storage cells to contain a greater reactive mass. These improvements allow a significant increase in the productive capacity of Continuum cores.
NUCLEAR EPITAXY
Nuclear Epitaxy allows solid matter to be constructed at the subatomic level without the energy required by transporter-based methods. As a result, the durable materials preferred in large-scale construction are now more readily available.
BEAM MICROPULSING
Micropulsed beams are fired in a series of bursts rather than a constant beam. The difference is visually undetectable, but increases the energy required by resisting shields -- thus effectively increasing shield penetration.
DYNAMIC ECOLOGICAL MODIFICATION
New research in planetary ecology has provided a greater understanding of the function of planets as whole entities. Using this understanding, terraformers can now streamline their efforts on alien worlds.
VIRTUAL PARTICLE PHYSICS
Many advanced technologies are dependent on exotic nuclear and chemical compounds. This revolutionary technology allows the creation of "virtual particles" which simulate the presence of such compounds.
FIELD DISTORTION CIRCUITRY
WIth this technology, a nonpropulsive Continuum field distorts the circuits of a computer core. This propulsion does not move the computer, but it does accelerate the movements of data, allowing signals and processes to exceed lightspeed.
CONTINUUM FIELD COMPRESSION
An application of Continuum Field Geometry, this technology allows Continuum fields to be compressed into narrower ellipses. This allows Continuum fields to conform more closely to the shapes of the vessels they propel, eliminating wasted subspace distortion.
ELECTRON BONDING
Electron Bonding is a sophisticated welding process which excites surface electrons to create strong nuclear bonds without causing any collateral damage or residual heat.
ANTIMATTER COMPRESSION
Using a small-scale nonpropulsive Continuum field, a torpedo's antimatter load can be compressed, and therefore increased. This allows the reactive mass to equal the total normal mass of the torpedo.
XENOBIOLOGY
Life on alien worlds frequently evolves differently from familiar lifeforms. Investigation of exotic alien lifeforms has led to renewed understanding of the power of carbon-based genetics, and fantastic advances in bioengineering.
ULTRACONDUCTOR PHYSICS
A quantified theory regarding the physical properties which allow ultraconductive materials to exist and function. Ultraconductive materials have a negative effective resistance -- they actually add energy to a current which runs through them.
ULTRACONDUCTIVE CIRCUITRY
When exposed to a current, Ultraconductive circuit elements add electromagnetic energy to the current, and thus have an effectively negative resistance. This results in a significant reduction in power requirements for large-scale computer elements.
QUANTUM CHARGE REVERSAL
Quantum Charge Reversal is the direct transformation of matter into anti-matter. This process takes a great deal of energy, but extends the effective range of starships by allowing them to stretch their antimatter fuel supplies.
QUANTUM EPITAXY
An advanced form of nuclear epitaxy, Quantum epitaxy allows the quantum states of subatomic particles to be adjusted without the energy required by transporter-based methods. Virtually any solid matter can be fabricated by this method.
QUANTUM SHIELDING
A torpedo detonation sends energy in every direction, and any energy which is not directed at the enemy vessel or its shields is wasted. Quantum shielding is a euphemism for quantum-mechanical shaping of the torpedo blast so that all the energy is directed at the enemy vessel (or its shields).
SILICOBIOLOGY
Comparative study of lifeforms based on elements other than carbon (such as silicon) is the key to understanding the nature of life itself.
WAVE FUNCTION ANALYSIS
All matter is energy, and all energy exists as probabilistic waves. Therefore, everything in the universe is ultimately a wave function. Wave Function Analysis is the direct observation of these waves; it provides insight into the most mysterious processes of the universe.
POSITRONICS
The artificial self-awareness demonstrated by large-scale quadritronic computers is apparently inherent to even the smallest positronic units. These computers appear capable of self-design and self-programming; they learn and adapt to repeated tasks, constantly improving their own performance.
ULTRACONDUCTIVE NACELLE COILS
Ultraconductive coils augment the power generated by a starship's Continuum drive with absorbed energy, effectively reducing the power required to generate a Continuum field. The energy is absorbed from both electromagnetic and subspace sources.
HOLOGRAPHIC CONSTRUCTION
Advances in holographics now allow large-scale construction to be carried out efficiently by holographic machinery, which can be instantly reconfigured whenever new methods arise.
ULTRACONDUCTIVE EMITTERS
By enhancing the charge that passes through them, Ultraconductive beam emitters increase the potential energy of beam attacks. These emitters can be installed in personnel weapons as easily as starship-grade beams.
SIALO-BIONICS
New-type silicon organisms are capable of penetrating the outer continental carapace with its high percentage of Si- and Al-oxides and making it far more fertile for carbon-based common plants. This is accomplished by complex gene-programming and their beneficial "natural" metabolic end products.
QUANTUM DETERMINACY
Quantum Determinacy allows physicists to force an event to occur as long as its quantum probability is above a certain threshold. As this technology is explored, the necessary threshold of probability will approach zero.
BIONEURAL CIRCUITRY
With advancements in silicon biology, bioneural circuits form computer circuits with organic components that can sort electrical signals and eliminate background "noise", resulting in less energy consumption and faster processing times.
QUANTUM SLIP STREAM
Continuum fields manipulated at quantum level enable a much smoother flight with less friction and risk to burst the continuum bubble. Thereby mean and maximum continuum speed can be increased.
ABLATIVE PLATING
By means of well-tried ablative techniques construction units can sustain heavier loads than before and complete their tasks in much faster time.
QUANTUM DISRUPTORS
Parallel to energy tech development the military showed interest in this field and forced testing of so-called "Atomkillers". By means of time-controlled detonation of these new "atomic bombs" all the explosive power of atomic destruction can be focussed on one target area.
MEMBRANE-CONTROLLING
The field of silicon organism research has proven to be a pure bonanza. Now we are capable of controlling bio-membranes in each cell selectively with specially-engineered silicon-based mitochondria responsive to commonplace magnetic spintronic devices. Extirpating vermins in mass numbers has become a child's play now, exterminating intelligent life however too.
QUANTUM DISRUPTION
Atomic physicists have reached a threshold within atoms and their subcomponents at which they can be destructed completely by concerted magnetic field movements. All quarks disappear immediately and leave a Higgs-free space at their place which saves the energy of the explosion and particle dissolvement and can give it off with corresponding stimulation.
HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFACING
Holographic technological breakthroughs now make it possible for a more natural communication rather then simple voice commands. Hailing from original work on artificial holographic life forms new holographic interfacing communication takes place as if both parties were in the same room.
CONTINUUM TIME REVERSAL
By sophisticated movement- and creation patterns time can be halted before entering a continuum bubble and be moved along the imaginery axis which results in an abrupt resetting on the real axis once entered. This allow to temporally and directly reduce flight times.
CRYSTALLINE PLATING
Ablative materials have proven to be more durable than expected when they are combined with particular iridium-aragonite crystals. Our construction robots will forthwith be equipped with this new alloy.
MIRV-DISRUPTORS
These extended quantum disruptor charges work like swarm missiles and can be positronically guided into their target in a series of sharp explosions that penetrate hulls and shields deeper than a single detonation could achieve.
HELIOPONICS
With Helium-enriched air special yeast organisms grow optimally in this type of air which makes it now possible to use higher layers in the atmosphere to grow plants on.
STRING GENERATORS
With progressing engine technology string applications in the energy field become more and more interesting and enriches power generation with a new exciting alternative.
ORGANIC MEMORY
A total reliance put towards biological components and neural systems, the bioorganic computer is now extended to include both the computer core and further system wide components never mind that of the original bio neural gel circuitry employed on older ship designs. This gives rise to a system that not only drastically improves performance but also allows for complete autonomic function and self-design.
QUANTUM DISRUPTION DRIVE
This engine technology is based on the quantum disruption theory and allows faster accelerations and longer voyages in continuum space since energy yield lies considerably above older fusion-type engines.
REGENERATIVE SIALO-PLATING
After being widely accepted and used new silicon bionics moves into construction tech area and excels particularly as durance and regeneration material on ablative surfaces which simplifies and removes maintenance tasks to a great extent.
TEMPORAL WEAPONS
The new continuum time reversal technology has delighted the military which resulted in an interesting application, the so-called temporal cage. Enemy objects are forced into a time loop by means of a special missile for a certain period of time which reverts itself back to their previous positions. This gives a clear and predictable target for torpedo and laser fire significantly increasing accuracy and hits.
TECTONIC-STABILISATION
Advances in computer modelling and energy wave front control throughout the planets crust structure now allow scientists to predict future build-up of tectonic pressure. Engineers are now better able to combat and stabilise planets with an increased tectonic instability and therefore open up new worlds for colonisation.
UBER-CORE PHYSICS
Due to relativistic effects chemical properties deviate at high nucleon atoms from usual non-relativistic predictions. Now an island group of elements have been synthesized that prove to be markedly stable and even allow energy-gaining nuclear fusion above ferrum.
CYBERNETICS
The dream to combine humanoids and machines on a physical level has been gloriously accomplished by a team of positronic scientists. This time a human can be transformed into a cybernetic being rather than starting from just a computer and emulating humanoid behaviour and capabilities on it.
GRAVITON DRIVE
By ingenious harnessing of graviton streams in space, scan devices can be jammed effectively which allows to travel at faster speeds without being more at risk of detection than usual.
REPLICATOR-UNITS
Equipped with latest silicon technology these positronic construction units are capable of accomplishing nearly every task without even being expensively pre-programmed. Thus the last big resort of human workpower has fallen and is replaced by much faster, intelligent machines.
INTELLIGENT WEAPON SYSTEMS
Many weapon systems in the past have claimed this name but only this new type of technology earns it finally. Positronic and replicator technology accounts for a fully-independent self-programming and artificially intelligent design that can be applied to ship classes, troops and even buildings. Manual override is still possible but officers who presume to do that must beware slight sarcasm coming from this fascinating type of machine.
